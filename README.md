# welcome to PythonicOS

built ontop of a custom ISO version of TinyCore Linux, PythonicOS is made for the pythoners that want to play around with python in a vm or a actual machine, it includes pip, pyQT and the respective packages.

there are 2 versions of this Operating system.

one built in Tkinter for compatibility with older software.

and one built in PyQT for later software.

its best to use the Tkinter one as its easy to use and better overall for development!

thanks ofr taking the time to read this garbage intro readme!
