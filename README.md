this is the first beta release of PythonicOS! if you ever run into a error, please make a issue about it!

if you want to get started, just go into the python folder and run main.py.

then when you get to the shell just type start!


this read me would be bigger but i dont want to have 2 diffrent readmes for both the main and beta!
