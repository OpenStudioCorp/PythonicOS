# whats happened
### Overview

The repositories PythonicOS-beta and PythonicOS-DEV/DEVV has been archived due to an accidental duplication of forks and subsequent realization that branches could be used instead. As a result, both forks were archived to avoid confusion and consolidate development efforts into a single repository.
Background

The duplication occurred when the repository owner accidentally forked the original repository multiple times, unaware that branches within a single fork could achieve the desired functionality. Recognizing the redundancy and potential confusion caused by maintaining multiple forks, the decision was made to archive both repositories and focus efforts on the primary fork.
Actions Taken

    The original repository was forked unintentionally, resulting in two separate copies.
    After realizing the duplication, it was decided to use branches within a single repository to manage different development efforts.
    Both forks were archived to streamline development and avoid unnecessary duplication.
    The primary fork is now the active repository, where further development and collaboration will take place.

# Next Steps

Moving forward, the primary Repo OpenStudio/PythonicOS will be the central repository for development efforts. Here's what you can do:

    If you have previously cloned or forked one of the archived repositories, it is recommended to update your remote URLs to point to the primary fork.
    Ensure you are working with the latest version of the primary fork by pulling the latest changes.
    If you were contributing to one of the archived forks, please redirect your efforts to the primary fork and submit any future pull requests there.
    Be mindful of the branching structure within the primary repository to organize and manage different features or development streams.

Contact

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the repository status or the archiving process, please feel free to reach out to the repository owner via the available communication channels.

We apologize for any confusion caused by the accidental duplication of forks, and appreciate your understanding as we consolidate our development efforts into a single repository.
